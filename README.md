🌊 River Water Level Monitoring and Alert System
📌 Description

A solar-powered IoT-based system that continuously monitors river water levels using sensors and sends real-time alerts via GSM/LoRa to support flood prevention and effective water resource management.

❓ Problem

Manual river monitoring is slow, risky, and unreliable during floods. Many river locations lack electricity and internet connectivity, leading to delayed flood warnings and poor water management decisions.

💡 Solution

This project provides an autonomous, floating monitoring system that measures water levels in real time and automatically sends data and alerts to authorities. The system operates independently using solar power and works even in remote areas.

⚙️ How It Works

Ultrasonic sensors measure the river water level

Arduino processes the sensor data

Data is transmitted using GSM/LoRa communication

Water levels are displayed on a cloud dashboard

Alerts are triggered when water crosses safe limits
